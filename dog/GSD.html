<p><h1>German Shepherds.</h1></p>

<p>The German Shepherd Dog,[a] also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[2]</p>

<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[3] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[4] In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[4] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[3]</p>

<p>To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[4] The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[4] some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[5] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.</p>

<p>With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[4] At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[4] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[4] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[4]</p>

<p>In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.[4] Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.[3] After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).[3] Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.[4] In just a few decades of the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.[6]</p>

<p>Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and Württemberg.[4] Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.[4][7] Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.[4] This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.[4] Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.[8]</p>

<p>During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.[6] German shepherds were coveted as "germanische Urhunde", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.[9] Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named "Prinz" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.[10] Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'Führerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover.[9] Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.[11] Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.[12] German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.<sup>[13]</sup></p>

<p>When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[14] But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[15][16] The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.[17] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.</p>

<p><h2 id="naming"> Naming</h2></p>
<p>The breed was named Deutscher Schäferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to "German Shepherd Dog".[19] At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Schäferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.</p>

<p>The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word "German" would harm the breed's popularity,[20] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[21] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to "Alsatian Wolf Dog",[20] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[4]</p>

Eventually,[when?] the appendage "wolf dog" was dropped,[20] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[4] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[20] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[22] The word "Alsatian" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.[23]</p>

<p><h2>Description</h2></p>
<p>German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[24] The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.[25][26][27] German Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[28] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[26]

<p>German Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[26][28][29] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[30]</p>

<p>Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an overall "blanket". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows</p>
